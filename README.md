# Information

## Short course pool

* The short course pool lengbth is 72 ft 2 in, which is not 25 m (82.02 ft).  It is not even 25 y.  It is 24.055 y.
* The width is 50 ft (same as old).
* There are six lanes, and they are 8 ft wide, with a 1 ft gap at each edge. This means we need 7 lane ropes for this distance.
* The backstroke flags are positioned 15 ft, which is 5 yd, and assumign we are calling this a 25 yd pool
* The depth at the pool house side starts at 5 ft ending at 12 ft 6 in at the far edge (close to the old start end).
* The depth at the opposite side is mostly the same, though the grading starts in a different lane.

## Long course pool

* The long course pool length is 164 ft 2 in, which is 50.028m (same as old)
* The width is 50 ft (same as old).
* There are six lanes, and they are 8 ft wide, with a 1 ft gap at each edge. This means we need 7 lane ropes for this distance.
* The backstroke flags are positioned 15 ft, which is 5 yd, not 5 m.
* The depth at the diving board side (old start end, new start end) is 9 ft at lane 1 (close to pool house) and 12 ft 6 in at the opposite side (lane 6).
* The depth at the finish side is 3 ft across, and becomes 4 ft maybe 10 ft after the expansion joint (maybe the 25 m point?) and then 3 ft the rest of the
way in starting another 12 ft further.

# Questions

1. Are the ladders removable?
2. Are the guard chairs anchored and removable, or are the all portable?  A note seems to indicate they are movable.
3. They depict starting block anchors on the pool house side.  We don't need anchors.
4. Are the diving boards removable?
